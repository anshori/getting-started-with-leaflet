# Getting Started with Leaflet
[Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html) is the leading open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. It is designed with simplicity, performance, and usability in mind. It works efficiently across all major desktop and mobile platforms, can be extended with lots of plugins, has a beautiful, easy to use and well-documented API and a simple, readable source code.

## The Basics
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript

### File Structure  
* :open_file_folder: _app_  
  * style.css  
  * script.js  
* :open_file_folder: _leaflet_  
  * leaflet.css  
  * leaflet.js  
* :open_file_folder: _esri leaflet (where applicable)_   
  * esri-leaflet.js
