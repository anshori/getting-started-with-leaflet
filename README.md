## Background
While this workshops focuses on open source platforms, students can apply the skills learned in the classroom to work with other mapping libraries!

This course teaches students about the [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html) and [Esri Leaflet](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet) libraries; two of the leading open-source JavaScript libraries for mobile-friendly interactive maps. Leaflet is designed with simplicity, performance, and usability in mind. It works efficiently across all major desktop and mobile platforms, can be extended with lots of plugins, is well-documented, and has a readable source code.
